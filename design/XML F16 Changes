The Changes that were made from the Old XML to the New XML for the F16
-- Here Are Some Changes From the First 400 Lines of the differences between the Old and New XML files for the F16 --

An XML Stylesheet was added
<?xml-stylesheet href="JSBSim.xsl" type="application/xml"?> – OLD
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/JSBSim.xsl"?> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/JSBSim.xsd"> – NEW

Metrics
In the old XML in the metrics - wing_incidence was removed in the new XML 
New Location named ‘VRP’ has its value x changed from 0 to -180.

Mass & Balance 
Added a true append to negated_crossproduct_inertia in the mass_balance class. 
Not much other change, 

Ground Reactions 
For NOSE_LG, the spring_coeff is changed from 15000 -> 17250.
For NOSE_LG, the damping_coeff is changed from 5000 -> 4250.
For LEFT_MLG, the spring_coeff is changed from 22704-> 37500.
For LEFT_MLG,  the damping_coeff is changed from 10000-> 7500.
For LEFT_WT, RIGHT_WT, TOP_VS, LEFT_VFT, RIGHT_VFT, INTAKE, and RADOME - have all had fields (max_steer, brake_group, and retractable) removed. 

External Reactions 
New section added that wasnt in the old XML file named external_reactions.
Within there are two new forces for frame = ‘BODY’, being pushback and hook which both include location and direction. 
*New behavior to implement 

Propulsion
Old XML had engine-level location and orient fields. 
But leaves these two for thrusters only, with some of the feed lines being changed. 
Tanks remain unchanged. 

Systems 
New entries being system file = ‘pushback’ , and ‘hook’
Seems to match with the above Enternal Reactions 
Pushback has three new property items.
Was not in the old XML structure. 
Need to ensure these are handled since they are new

Flight Control System
The old XML had one interface property - fcs/alpha-norm
New XML includes fcs/hook-engage, fcs/canopy-engage, fcs/fbw-override
Many channels were added in the new XML which were not present in the old XML such as - Flaps, Yaw, Landing Gear, Leading Edge Flap, Throttle, Speedbrake, Hook, Canopy
Within the Roll channel, these were the changes 
Within the old XML, the separate fields pure_gain, integrator, lead_lag_filter, and form PIDs. 
The new XML uses a single <pid> block with a <switch> trigger, making the gains slightly different, 
The Pitch channel was almost entirely changed.
Old XML had P+I+D for pure/integrator/lead_lag, path
New XML added gravity correction, alpha limiting, speed gating switch, <pid> for g-load, richer kinematics, and aerosurface ranges. 
The other changes for some of the other new channels that weren't as major - 
Flaps - adds schedule + kinematics traverse 
Yaw - adds schedule normalization, PID, and aerosurface mapping 
Landing Gear - adds WOW logic and kinematic timing, scheduled steering
Leading Edge Flap - logic with multiple conditional tests and aerosurface scaling
Speedbrake - alpha/speed guard, scheduled limiter, kinematic to degrees, and normalization 
Hook - kinematics with timings and triggers
Canopy - kinematics with timings and triggers

Aerodynamics 
New file starts filling aero functions
Old snippet ends mid-Roll channel; no aero shown there, so we can’t line-by-line compare further here.
