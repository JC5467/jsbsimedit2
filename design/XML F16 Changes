The Changes that were made from the Old XML to the New XML for the F16
-- Here Are Some Changes From the First 400 Lines of the differences between the Old and New XML files for the F16 --

An XML Stylesheet was added
<?xml-stylesheet href="JSBSim.xsl" type="application/xml"?> – OLD
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/JSBSim.xsl"?> xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/JSBSim.xsd"> – NEW

Metrics
In the old XML in the metrics - wing_incidence was removed in the new XML 
New Location named ‘VRP’ has its value x changed from 0 to -180.

Mass & Balance 
Added a true append to negated_crossproduct_inertia in the mass_balance class. 
Not much other change, 

Ground Reactions 
For NOSE_LG, the spring_coeff is changed from 15000 -> 17250.
For NOSE_LG, the damping_coeff is changed from 5000 -> 4250.
For LEFT_MLG, the spring_coeff is changed from 22704-> 37500.
For LEFT_MLG,  the damping_coeff is changed from 10000-> 7500.
For LEFT_WT, RIGHT_WT, TOP_VS, LEFT_VFT, RIGHT_VFT, INTAKE, and RADOME - have all had fields (max_steer, brake_group, and retractable) removed. 

External Reactions 
New section added that wasnt in the old XML file named external_reactions.
Within there are two new forces for frame = ‘BODY’, being pushback and hook which both include location and direction. 
*New behavior to implement 

Propulsion
Old XML had engine-level location and orient fields. 
But leaves these two for thrusters only, with some of the feed lines being changed. 
Tanks remain unchanged. 

Systems 
New entries being system file = ‘pushback’ , and ‘hook’
Seems to match with the above Enternal Reactions 
Pushback has three new property items.
Was not in the old XML structure. 
Need to ensure these are handled since they are new

Flight Control System
The old XML had one interface property - fcs/alpha-norm
New XML includes fcs/hook-engage, fcs/canopy-engage, fcs/fbw-override
Many channels were added in the new XML which were not present in the old XML such as - Flaps, Yaw, Landing Gear, Leading Edge Flap, Throttle, Speedbrake, Hook, Canopy
Within the Roll channel, these were the changes 
Within the old XML, the separate fields pure_gain, integrator, lead_lag_filter, and form PIDs. 
The new XML uses a single <pid> block with a <switch> trigger, making the gains slightly different, 
The Pitch channel was almost entirely changed.
Old XML had P+I+D for pure/integrator/lead_lag, path
New XML added gravity correction, alpha limiting, speed gating switch, <pid> for g-load, richer kinematics, and aerosurface ranges. 
The other changes for some of the other new channels that weren't as major - 
Flaps - adds schedule + kinematics traverse 
Yaw - adds schedule normalization, PID, and aerosurface mapping 
Landing Gear - adds WOW logic and kinematic timing, scheduled steering
Leading Edge Flap - logic with multiple conditional tests and aerosurface scaling
Speedbrake - alpha/speed guard, scheduled limiter, kinematic to degrees, and normalization 
Hook - kinematics with timings and triggers
Canopy - kinematics with timings and triggers

Aerodynamics 
New file starts filling aero functions
Old snippet ends mid-Roll channel; no aero shown there, so we can’t line-by-line compare further here.

Aileron 
New xml "Multiple <aerosurface_scale>, <switch>, <kinematic>, <scheduled_gain>, <summer>
Old XML <aerosurface_scale>, left/right only
Note: Expanded logic: feedback, speed compensation, flaperon mixing; renamed tags with fcs/ prefix

Pitch 
New xml <fcs/n-pilot-z- correction>, <summer>, <scheduled_gain>, <pid>
Old xml Not present
Note: Entirely new channel; adds PID control, g-load correction, alpha limiter, elevator scheduling

Yaw 
New xml <scheduled_gain>, <pure_gain>, <summer>, <pid>
Old xml <pure_gain>, <summer>, <integrator>, <lead_lag_filter>
Note: PID simplified and modularized; added airspeed- based triggers, yaw load normalization, switch logic

Landing Gear
New xml <switch> (WOW), <kinematic>, <scheduled_gain>
Old xml <kinematic> and <scheduled_gain>
Note: Added weight-on-wheels detection; standardized ranges; minor reformatting

Removed/Replaced
New xml Not present
Old xml Leading Edge Flap, Throttle, Flaps, Speedbrake
Note: Removed in new XML, possibly handled elsewhere

Naming/Formatting
New xml Standardized fcs/prefix; consistent indentation
Old xml Mixed names, some descriptive (e.g., “Left Aileron Control”)
Note: Easier to read and maintain

Functional Enhancements
New xml Added FBW override switches, speed compensation, flaperon mix, g-load & alpha correction
Old xml Basic control scaling
Note: More realistic flight control simulation

Drag
New xml <CDDlef> (table), <CDDflaps> (scalar), <CDgear> (scalar), <CDDsb> (table), <CDq> (table), <CDq_Dlef> (table)
Old xml Not Present
Note: Entirely new drag functions added; includes LE flap, trailing flaps, gear, speedbrake, 
pitch-rate effects; adds alpha, flap, gear, speedbrake, and pitch-rate dependencies. 
Enables GUI to show drag contributions dynamically.

Pitch
New xml Same as old
Old xml <CmDh> (alpha × elevator table), <Cma_M> (mach table), <Cmq> (alpha × pitch-rate table)
Note: Minor formatting adjustments; no new functions. GUI can use existing tables for elevator, alpha, and pitch-rate inputs

Side Force
New xml <CYb> (scalar), <CYb_M> (mach table), <CYDa> (scalar), <CYdr> (scalar), <CYp> (alpha × roll-rate table), 
<CYr> (alpha × yaw-rate table)
Old xml Not present
Note: New side-force functions added; includes beta, aileron, rudder, roll rate, yaw rate effects, and Mach dependencies. 
Simplifies GUI implementation for side forces.

Roll Moment
New xml Same as old
Old xml Clp> (alpha × roll-rate table), <Clr> (alpha × yaw-rate table), <Clda> (alpha × beta × aileron table), 
<Clda_M> (mach table), <Cldr> (alpha × beta × rudder table), <Cldr_M> (mach table)
Note: No changes; multi- column alpha × beta tables retained. GUI can keep old roll/yaw moment visualization

Naming/Formatting 
New xml Standardized tags with fcs/ prefix; consistent indentation; mostly 1D tables or scalars
Old xml Mixed descriptive names, some multi-column tables
Note: Easier to read, maintain, and parse; fcs/ prefix clarifies control surface inputs (LEF, flaps, aileron, rudder).

Function Enhancements
New xml Adds drag forces, side forces, Mach effects, combined effects (CDq_Dlef); scalars for simple forces
Old xml Only moments, limited surfaces, older scaling
Note: More realistic aerodynamic modeling; GUI can implement sliders for alpha, Mach, control surfaces, 
speedbrake, gear, pitch/roll rates, etc.

Pitch
New xml <function name=“"aero/coefficient/CmDsb">
Old xml Not Present 
Note: New function added(Line:1662). named “Change_in_Pitch_moment_due_to_speedbrake”

Output
New xml Not present
Old xml <output>
Note: Removed in new XML(Line:1917). present but commented out
